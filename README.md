<h2>About</h2>


<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

The project was designed to learn the fundamentals of programming and the c++ language by recreating some of the core mechanics of mario and developing it into a short platformer. Use WASD to control the boy and the arrow keys to control the cat as you try to reach the end door. You can kill slimes by jumping on their heads. 

<h2>Key learnings</h2>

- File Handling
- Procedurally textured tiles 
- Basic collision systems including bounding boxes and bounding circles 
- Scene management
