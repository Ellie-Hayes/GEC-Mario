<h2>About</h2>


<h2>Goal and requirements</h2>

The project was designed to learn the fundamentals of programming and the c++ language by recreating some of the core mechanics of mario and developing it into a short platformer.

- File Handling
- Procedurally textured tiles 
- Basic collision systems including bounding boxes and bounding circles
